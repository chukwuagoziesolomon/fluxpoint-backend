## REMAINING PAIRS (47 SETUPS TOTAL)

### AUDUSD (7 setups), USDCAD (7 setups)
- Each has 7 valid setups with confirmed uptrend/downtrend patterns and MA retests

### EURGBP (5 setups), EURJPY (5 setups), GBPJPY (5 setups), NZDJPY (5 setups)
- Each has 5 valid setups with clear trend confirmation and Fibonacci levels

### EURUSD (3 setups), USDCHF (3 setups)
- Each has 3 valid setups with strict MA alignment and candlestick patterns

### AUDJPY (1 setup)
- 1 valid setup found with complete validation

### USDJPY (0 setups) ❌
- **Issue**: USDJPY typically trades in a choppy/sideways range
- MAs don't maintain strict order (MA6 > MA18 > MA50 > MA200)
- Most candles show "NEUTRAL" trend (MAs mixed)
- **Solution**: Use relaxed MA alignment (only 3-of-4 MAs in order)

---

## WHAT EACH ENTRY REASON MEANS

### 1️⃣ **Uptrend / Downtrend**
- **Uptrend**: MA6 > MA18 > MA50 > MA200 (fast MAs above slow MAs)
- **Downtrend**: MA200 > MA50 > MA18 > MA6 (slow MAs above fast MAs)
- **Requirement**: At least 2 of 3 slopes (slope6, slope18, slope50) positive/negative

### 2️⃣ **Fibonacci Retest**
- Price has retraced **38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%** from the high/low
- **Example BUY**: High at 1.3000, price drops 61.8% to 1.2882, now bouncing back (entry at 1.2900)
- **Example SELL**: Low at 1.2800, price rises 50% to 1.2900, now pulling back (entry at 1.2880)

### 3️⃣ **MA Level**
- Current price is **within 5% of MA6, MA18, MA50, or MA200**
- This is the "bounce point" where price acts as support/resistance

### 4️⃣ **MA Retest**
- The same MA has been **tested in the last 20 candles**
- **Example**: 
  - Candle 5: Price bounced off MA18
  - Candle 18: Price tests MA18 again (retest)
  - Entry condition confirmed!

### 5️⃣ **Candlestick Pattern**
- **Pin bar**: Long wick, small body (buyers/sellers reject)
- **Engulfing**: Current candle completely envelops previous (reversal)
- **Rejection candle**: Long lower wick (buyers reject lower prices)
